/**
 * Cross-platform wrapper for thread-local storage.
 *
 * Like Boost [1] and Folly [2] implementations, this implementation
 * multiplexes multiple values onto the same underlying system-specific
 * thread local value. This plays well with use of pthread_key_t (limited
 * number of keys available) as well as __declspec(thread) on Windows
 * (POD types only). Like the Folly implementation, uses an array and
 * free list for handle storage rather than an ordered map (as Boost does),
 * allowing O(1) access (new thread local creations should be rare).
 *
 * The tagged allocation reservoir in the Folly implementation may be useful
 * for avoiding contention if the rare-creation assumption turns out not
 * to be true, or if serialization on thread creation & deletion is somehow
 * concerning (hint: it's not), or if I add iteration.
